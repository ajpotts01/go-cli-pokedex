# go-cli-pokedex
Golang Pokedex from boot.dev

This is a Pokedex CLI created as part of a guided project at [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev), a site specifically designed to teach backend skills.

The Pokedex will allow you to do the following:
- Explore areas
- Catch Pokemon in those areas
- View caught Pokemon in your Pokedex, including stats

The project is "complete" as far as the tutorial goes, but the following remains to be done:
- Unit tests/refactoring to be test friendly
- Pokemon battles

To run:
- Install [Go 1.21.0](https://go.dev/blog/go1.21)
- Clone the repository
- Run `go build`
- Run `./go-cli-pokedex`
